## Consider contributing
As said in the `README` file, this is a starter project, made to learn Rust. So if you wish to contribute just please keep in mind what the original purpose of the project was. That being said, thank you for considering contributing.

## Report issues
If during use, or from reading the code, yoh find any issues, please report it. Open an issue in the GitHub repository, with details of what you found and how to reproduce it.

## Refactor
If you find any piece of code you wish to rewrite in a better way, please feel free to do it. When you're done just submit a pull request with your changes and an explanation to why the refactoring is better.

## Add new features
If you come up with a new feature you wish to implement, you're welcome to do it. In your fork, create your additions, and once you're done submit a pull request with everything. If the feature seems fitting to the project, it'll be merged into the master branch.

One idea, if you're interested in making contributions, is just adding new bases, with conversion to all other existing bases.

## Thank you
If you end up deciding to chnage something or open an issue, thanks for giving your time and effort to this.
