# Learn

This project was made with the initial intention of learning Rust. As of writing this, I'm still learning the language and this was my very first project with it. 
As to it's features, the idea came from needing to make base conversions during class and not wanting to leave the terminal. Since I was already learning Rust, I decided to go with it to make a CLI.

If you've never used Rust, I wouldn't recommend using this project to learn. Personally, I'm using the [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as the main source to learn the language. The [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises are also a useful resource, as well as watching videos to learn more specific subjects or frameworks. 

Since I've never built a CLI with Rust, I used [this starter guide](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html) to get started with the basic tool. 

As to the conversions, I just translated [the way we do it by hand](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/number_system_conversion.htm) into code. Im sure there are some way better and more perfomatic ways to do it. But this fits my need well enough and was simple to implement. You're welcome to make better algorithms though, just male sure to read `CONTRIBUTING.md` first.
